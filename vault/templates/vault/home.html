        <p>Vault Haxor is a simple credential management system inspired by 
        LastPass, 1Password, and other similar solutions.</p>
        <p>I wrote Vault Haxor as the final study project in the Network and 
        Information Security program at Noroff Vocational College.
        The project was designed to be as simple as possible while maintaining 
        confidentiality, integrity, and (hopefully) availability. 
        Luckily for you, you can use the app for free. ðŸ˜‰
        </p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p><strong>How does the app maintain confidentiality?</strong> 
        It does so by using clientside cryptography on all data except user email. 
        The only reason why your email is not encrypted is that the email will 
        be used to send you critical information about updates that affect you.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How is clientside cryptography different from "normal" 
        confidentiality?</strong>
        Because I don't want to risk any potential data breach on my server, where
        an attacker could set up any sniffer or logger to collect your 
        authentication attempts, thereby getting you passwords, and then use 
        that password to decrypt your credentials, the app generates a hash of 
        your password in your web browser and sends that hash to the server for 
        authentication. This makes it impossible for an attacker to gain access to
        your data without having access gained access to your password through 
        hacking your computer or by performing phishing or any other sort of
        social engineering attacks.
        </p>
        <p>Application names/website names, usernames, and passwords are stored 
        encrypted, and is only encrypted and decrypted in your web browser. 
        In other words, this application uses end-to-end encryption.
        This is done to make it impossible for me, who runs the application, or 
        anyone else who gains unauthorized access to sniff or log any part of 
        your stored credentials</p>
        <p><strong>Hashing</strong> of the master password for authentication is
        performed in the browser by using the Argon2 algorithm. To perform hashing,
        the open-source JavaScript library 
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/argon2-browser">argon2-browser</a>
        is used.</p>
        <p><strong>Encryption</strong> of the credentials is performed in the 
        browser by using the open-source JavaScript library
        <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js">crypto-js</a>.</p>

        <h2>Integrity</h2>
        <p><strong>How does the app maintain integrity?</strong>
        Haxor Vault maintains integrity by only allowing users to access and modify
        their own apps and credentials. This is done using a session token generated 
        when you log in and stored in your web browser. The token has a limited lifetime 
        and is used to verify that you are the one trying to access or modify
        your data. You cannot access or modify your data if the token is missing 
        or invalid. This token does not contain any sensitive or personally 
        identifiable information (PII) and is only used to verify your identity.

        <h2>Availability</h2>
        <p><strong>But, what about availability? Can you trust that the app will
         be running and available for use?</strong> I will try my best to
        keep this project running and having it available. The biggest incentive
        for keeping it running is that I use Vault Haxor myself. Since this is a 
        non-commercial and free app with no guarantees at all, I will not, under 
        any circumstances, guarantee the availability of the application. 
        Again, this is a hobby project and not a commercial product. 
        <strong> Do NOT expect availability from this app like what you would 
        expect from a commercial product.</strong></p>
